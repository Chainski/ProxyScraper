# 🕵️‍♂️ ProxyScraper

A high-performance multithreaded proxy scraper for Windows that fetches fresh HTTP, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5 proxies from a variety of public sources.

*NOTE: This library isn't designed for production use. It's advised to use your own proxies or purchase a service which provides an API. These are merely free ones that are retrieved from sites and should only be used for development or testing purposes.*



## 📌 Features

- [x] Scrapes HTTP/S, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5 proxies
- [x] Uses multithreading for fast downloads
- [x] Saves each proxy type to a separate `.txt` file
- [x] Displays colorful console banners and messages (ANSI)
- [x] Uses Windows WinHTTP API (native, no third-party deps)
